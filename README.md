# GSoC Scraper
With the help of requests and BeautifulSoup libraries this program is written to scrap the GSoC results of 2021 from [gsoc](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) site.<br>This takes some time so let it run for few minutes.<br>
I have downloaded the html data before hand so that this can work smoothly.
